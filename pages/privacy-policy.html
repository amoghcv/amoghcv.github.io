Longbow DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES AT THE TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING; THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE GAME OR THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
			<h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
			<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Longbow SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUES, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (HOWEVER SUCH LOSSES ARE QUALIFIED), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICES OR THE SERVICES ITSELF, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT Longbow HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Longbow SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO Longbow IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICES IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANYTHING TO Longbow DURING SUCH TIME PERIOD, YOUR SOLE REMEDY (AND Longbow’ EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY) FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH Longbow IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES AND CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
			<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of these disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you. To the extent that Longbow may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of Longbow’ liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law. In particular, nothing in these Terms of Services shall affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of Longbow.</p>
			<h4>INDEMNITY</h4>
			<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Longbow harmless from any claim, demand, damages or other losses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, asserted by any Third Party resulting from or arising out of any breach by you of this Terms of Services. Longbow reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Longbow, and you agree to cooperate with Longbow’ defense of these claims. Longbow will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</p>
			<p>You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your Account(s) or of the Services.</p>
			<h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND APPLICABLE LAW</h4>
			<p>If a dispute arises between you and Longbow, Longbow strongly encourages you to first contact Longbow directly to seek a resolution by opening a help ticket directly in-game via the help section or contact Longbow at contact@longbowgames.net.</p>
			<p>You agree that all disputes between you and Longbow shall be governed by the laws of India by a court located in Mysuru, Karnataka without regard to conflict of law provisions, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such court.</p>
			<h4>SEVERABILITY</h4>
			<p>If any portion of these Terms of Services or of the Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
			<h4>ASSIGNMENT</h4>
			<p>Longbow may assign or delegate these Terms of Services and/or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time, with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Services or Privacy Policy without Longbow’ prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.</p>
			<h4>NO CLASS ACTIONS</h4>
			<p>You and Longbow can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION AND CAN ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Longbow IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.</p>
			<p>That means</p>
			<ul>
				<li>neither you nor Longbow may bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action.</li>
				<li>the arbitrator or court cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless you and Longbow both agree to change this).</li>
				<li>the arbitrator’s or court’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other users of the Services, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>SUPPLEMENTAL POLICIES</h4>
			<p>Longbow may publish additional policies related to specific services such as forums, contests or loyalty programs. Your right to use such services is subject to those specific policies and these Terms of Services.</p>
			<h4>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
			<p>The Terms of Services and Privacy Policy contain the entire understanding of you and Longbow and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and us with respect to the Services.</p>
			<h4>NO WAIVER</h4>
			<p>The failure of Longbow to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Services or the Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Longbow’ right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p>
			<p>The express waiver by Longbow of any provision, condition or requirement of these Terms of Services or the Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>
			<p>Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms of Services, no representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by Longbow shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of Services nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Longbow.</p>
			<h4>EQUITABLE REMEDIES</h4>
			<p>You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms of Services to Longbow are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Longbow and that cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone, so that Longbow shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.</p>
			<p>You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Services or the games, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith or exploitation of the Services or any content or other material used or displayed through the Services and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any), limited by Sections 5.2 and 11.</p>
			<h4>FORCE MAJEURE</h4>
			<p>Longbow shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or causes beyond Longbow’ control such as natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>
			<h4>PARTNERSHIP</h4>
			<p>You agree that your use of the Services does not constitute any joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship between you and Longbow as a result of this Agreement.</p>
			<h4>NOTICES</h4>
			<p>Longbow may notify you via postings on www.longbowgamesindia.com, on app-store pages of the games, on Social Networking Sites, in the games and via e-mail or any other communication means using contact information you provide to us. All notices given by you or required from you under these Terms of Services or the Privacy Policy will be done to contact@longbowgames.net and will include your full name and a detailed description of why you are contacting Longbow.</p>
