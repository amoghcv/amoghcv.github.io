			<h4>FEES, PURCHASES &amp; TERMS</h4>
			<h4>Purchase of Virtual Items</h4>
			<p>You may purchase with “real world” money a limited, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable license to use (a) “virtual currency,” including but not limited to virtual cash, in-game coins and all other kinds of in-game monies, all for use only within the games; (b) virtual in-game items (virtual currency and virtual in-game items referred to collectively as “Virtual Items”); and (c) other goods or services (“Merchandise”) within the Services for your personal and non-commercial entertainment. You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from Longbow or its authorized partners through the Services, not in any other way.</p>
			<p>You understand that Longbow has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items and may revoke your access to them at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. Longbow shall have no liability to you or any Third Party in the event that Longbow exercises any such rights. You have no claim, right, title, proprietary or ownership interest in any of the Virtual Items regardless of any consideration paid for those virtual items.</p>
			<p>Except when explicitly authorized by Longbow, (i) transfers of Virtual Items to other user accounts are strictly prohibited; (ii) outside of the Services, you may not buy or sell any Virtual Items for “real world” money or otherwise exchange items for value; and (iii) Longbow does not recognize any such purported transfers of Virtual Items or the purported sale, gift or trade in the “real world” of anything that appears in the Services. Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is in violation of these Terms of Services and will result in an automatic termination of your rights to use the Virtual Items and may result in termination of your Account. All Virtual Items are forfeited if your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, or if Longbow discontinues providing the Services.</p>
			<p>You agree that you will not assert or bring any claim against Longbow, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or licensors relating to (i) a claim that you own any Virtual Items; or (ii) a claim for an alleged monetary value of Virtual Items lost upon deletion or suspension of your account or modification, termination or expiration of these terms.</p>
			<h4>Fees, Refunds &amp; Return Policy</h4>
			<p>All sales through the Service are final. You acknowledge and agree that any applicable fees and other charges (including, without limitation, virtual items) are not refundable in whole or in part. You are fully liable for all charges to your account, including any unauthorized charges. Longbow does not issue any refunds or offer any exchanges of any products purchased on or through the Services.</p>
			<p>IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, RECEIVE MONEY, OR BE OTHERWISE COMPENSATED FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS OR OTHER GAME ASSETS WHEN THE SERVICES ARE TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>
			<p>Longbow may, at any time, revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions or features of the game or any products sold through the Services.
