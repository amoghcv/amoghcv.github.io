              Where applicable, we process data under the following legal bases: <i>performance of a contract</i> (to provide the game and purchases), <i>legitimate interests</i> (security, analytics, non-personalized improvements), <i>consent</i> (personalized ads/trackers where required), and <i>legal obligation</i>.
